Honestly I took the notes a while ago so I basically went in and tried to "brute force" my way through the problem.
That only worked for so long until I tried to finally decided to read the documentation. 
When I first tried to understand all of it just by reading the documentation I didn't know what I was looking for,
I based my first design off of yours but didn't want to submit that because 1 that felt like cheating and 2, I didn't 
learn anything thing from copying stuff over. I looked at my note more closely and looked at the assignment specifics a
little more which helped with the current model. I fiddled with different number of conv2D and pooling layers along with
the filters and number of neurons. I learned that if you want a highly accurate AI that can determine pictures you're 
going to need a powerful computer. I also learned you can break things if there are too many conv2D and pooling layers. 
Some results were a little stagnant. To get the model that I have I basically tested different amounts of layers and 
values and recorded the results of them. The one I currently have takes a while, I feel like there is some sort of 
equation to help determine numbers. I might have missed something from the lecture.
